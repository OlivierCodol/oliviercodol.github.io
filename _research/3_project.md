  While rewarding feedback can improve motor control, it can also improve acquisition of new motor
  memories, a process often referred to as motor learning. But like for motor control, motor learning
  relies on different contributing mechanisms to produce the behavioural improvements we observe and
  quantify. While initially it was hypothesised that reinforcement could improve motor adaptation,
  a subset of motor learning that recalibrates sensorimotor mapping, colleagues and I show in a series
  of studies that reinforcement
  acts instead at another level, often called "explicit control".
  That is, reinforcement biases participants' voluntary strategy toward more rewarded actions,
  which is reminiscent of decision-making.
  We also show that participants' capacity to capitalize on such reinforcement feedback to improve their
  performance is tied to their working memory capacity rather than their dopaminergic genetic profile
  directly.

  A reccurent hope about motor learning through reinforcement has been to enhance sports coaching
  and motor rehabilitation procedures for clinical populations. The real potential for these applications
  is directly tied to how exactly reinforcement acts on the motor learning system, as different answers
  beset different prospects regarding their viability and means of achievement. You can find some
  points on this topic in chapter six of my Ph.D. thesis.
