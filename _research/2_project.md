  Providing rewarding feedback (money, food, etc..) is a reliable mean of improving someone's motor
  performance. In fact, there is nothing particularly surprising about the idea that rewarding
  (for instance, paying) someone to do well will actually make that person do better. But how
  exactly does the motor control system allow for this rather mundane phenomenon to happen is not
  particularly clear. In a series of studies, I systematically dissect the motor system
  to outline which functional components show modulation by rewarding feedback and which do not.
