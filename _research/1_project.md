      The field of motor control is sometimes referred to as "movement science". That very wording underlines
      a general state of affairs: when one asks <em>how does the brain controls the body?</em> what
      one often really asks is <em>how does the brain make the body move?</em> In reality, there are many situations where
      the brain decides to control the body not by initiating movement, but by controlling the biomechanical
      properties of the body. In fact, biomechanical properties can sometimes be controlled in complete
      independence from trajectory itself (e.g. this study
      <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79526-1" class="button icon-button-inline arrow-up-right" target="_blank"></a>
      ). I am currently working on untangling how control of body stiffness, or rigidity, relates to control of movement, and how
      stiffness is centrally regulated to enable stable, yet flexible control of the body.
