But like for motor control, motor learning relies on different contributing mechanisms to produce the behavioural improvements we observe and quantify. While initially it was hypothesised that reinforcement could improve motor adaptation, a subset of motor learning that recalibrates sensorimotor mapping, colleagues and I show in a series of studies that reinforcement acts instead at another level, often called "explicit control". That is, reinforcement biases participants' voluntary strategy toward more rewarded actions, which is reminiscent of decision-making. We also show that participants' capacity to capitalize on such reinforcement feedback to improve their performance is tied to their working memory capacity rather than their dopaminergic genetic profile directly. </p> <p> A reccurent hope about motor learning through reinforcement has been to enhance sports coaching and motor rehabilitation procedures for clinical populations. The real potential for these applications is directly tied to how exactly reinforcement acts on the motor learning system, as different answers beset different prospects regarding their viability and means of achievement.
