The first asset of this book is that it shows the maths only after explaining what we are trying to do, rather than before. Maths can be a bit of a scarecrow, but when we know what a formula is trying to achieve before we even get to it, it is usually easier to appreciate what it really represents.</p> <p class="mt-4">The second asset of this book is that, well, it still shows the maths. Many books go at lengths trying to build a maths-free intuition for the concepts discussed and then just don't bother showing the math at all, under the logic that an intuitive understanding is already conveyed. While this is a reasonable logic, it also misses on a great opportunity to link the now-gained intuitive understanding to its mathematical formalization, which is also a worthy skill to developp.</p> <p class="mt-4 mb-4">The third asset of this book is its exercice section at the end of each chapter. They are very well crafted, reasonably progressive in difficulty, and overall a great mean of playing with newly acquired concepts.</p> </div> <div> <img class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 200px; padding-left: 20px" src="/assets/img/book_covers/optimal-control-systems.tif" alt="Image"> </div> </div> </body></html>
