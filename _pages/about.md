I am a postdoctoral fellow interested in how the brain produces movements, as well as how it learns to do so through everyday experiences.
To do so, I combine behavioural experiments, biomechanical models, and machine learning methods such as deep learning and particularly deep reinforcement learning.
I am currently based at Mila—Quebec AI Institute and the Université de Montréal in Montréal, Québec, working with Matthew G. Perich and Guillaume Lajoie.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Sensorimotor Superlab at the Centre for Brain and Mind in London, Ontario, working with Paul L. Gribble.
Before  this, I completed my PhD in Birmingham, UK, where I was supervised by Joseph M. Galea and R. Chris Miall.

<h2 class="mb-3">Goals</h2>

<ul class="mb-3" style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li class="mb=1">
    Make my research more easily navigable by bringing together the resources scattered across (too many) platforms.
    </li>
  <li class="mb-1">
    Go beyond single-article narratives to link together observations and findings across studies.
    </li>
  <li class="mb-1">
    Make available resources that may be useful to others.
    </li>
  <li class="mb-1">
    Share pedagogic materials that turned out instrumental for self-learning.
    </li>
  <li class="mb-1">Learn to code in HTML and CSS. Also dabble with the basics of creative website design.</li>
</ul>
