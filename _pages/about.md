I am a postdoctoral fellow interested in how the brain produces movements, as well as how it learns to do so through everyday experiences.
To do so, I combine behavioural experiments, biomechanical models, and machine learning methods such as deep learning and particularly deep reinforcement learning.
I am currently based at Mila—Quebec AI Institute and the Université de Montréal in Montréal, Québec, working with Matthew G. Perich and Guillaume Lajoie.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Sensorimotor Superlab at the Centre for Brain and Mind in London, Ontario, working with Paul L. Gribble.
Before  this, I completed my PhD in Birmingham, UK, where I was supervised by Joseph M. Galea and R. Chris Miall.
