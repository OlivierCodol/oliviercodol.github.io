<p class="mb-5">Lateral numbers, better known as imaginary numbers, are somewhat mystifying because what they
  represent in real life seems difficult to grasp for the human mind.
  Who doesn't get a bit scared when their running code start returning <code>3 + 5i</code> seemingly out of
  the blue?
  This 13-episodes (!) series breaks down what lateral numbers are, why it should be called lateral numbers
  rather than imaginary numbers,
  and more importantly, why they should be no more mystifying than, say, negative numbers.
